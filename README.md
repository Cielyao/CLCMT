Main study: Cooperative Lane-changing in Mixed Traffic: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach

This paper introduces a DRL-based mechanism for cooperative lane changing in mixed traffic (CLCMT) for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The uncertainty of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the microscopic interactions between HVs and CAVs are explicitly modelled, and different leader-follower compositions are considered in CLCMT, which provides a high-fidelity DRL learning environment.

Follow-up study: Performance Comparison of Deep RL Algorithms for Mixed Traffic Cooperative Lane-Changing

In this study, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL algorithms including DDPG, TD3, SAC, and PPO are utilized to deal with the same lane-changing task, which is the formulated MDP with continuous actions. Performance comparison among the four DRL algorithms demonstrates that DDPG, TD3, and PPO algorithms can deal with uncertainty in traffic environments and learn well-performed LC strategies in terms of safety, efficiency, comfort, and ecology. The PPO algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms, regarding a higher reward, fewer exploration mistakes and crashes, and a more comfortable and ecology LC strategy. 

This environment can be used as the basis for any DRL-based simulations. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us!
